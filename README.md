## Simple Shop Frontend

This is a part of a project I did from [May 21st to June 7th, 2018](https://www.quora.com/What-can-a-one-man-web-developer-produce/answer/Nikolay-Konovalov-1).

It is a simple front-end for e-commerce website using Vue.js, Vuex, PayPal Checkout, Tawk.to, Element-UI, a few things from [12-factor](https://12factor.net/) (such as `.env` configuration files). For a full list, see [Built with](#built-with).
